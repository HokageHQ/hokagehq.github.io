                    <h3>Leona Maldiva</h3>
                    <p>One month ago I started exercising with Mariela as my trainer. Not having exercised for a long time I was apprehensive but when I met and got to know Mariela I knew that she was the perfect coach for me. She is professional yet kind, patient and understanding. Her encouragement has given me the confidence that I needed to start this program.</p>

                        You are a great trainer! You understand how to train someone who is not 22! You are patient, friendly and encouraging. I was more comfortable working with you than I've ever been with another trainer</p>

                        <h3>Linda Lin</h3>
                        <p>Ive been working with Kristy Belanger since May 2018. My goal initially was to lose weight. So faras of September 2018 I have lost 31 lbs and a total of 11.5 inches.This is all down to Kristy and her vast knowledge of fitness and dietary needs. During this time I have had a couple minor injuies to deal with and Kristy was able to adjust my program immediately and direct me to the proper professionals to help in my recovery. Looking forward to continuing to work with her in the future. Thanks Kristy</p>
